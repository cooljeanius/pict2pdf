pict2pdf will convert Apple PICT files to PDF files.Conversion is usually very good, but I have found some problemswith rotated text placed by MacDraw.  Evidently there is someincompatibility with how the PicComments used by MacDraw are handled.To install, you probably need the 10.2 development tools.  By defaultthe files will be installed into /usr/local, but this can bealtered using PREFIX in the Makefile. makemake test sudo make install
